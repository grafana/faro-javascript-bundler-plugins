That tab includes the necessary configuration for the Faro JavaScript bundler plugins, including the `appName`, `appId`, and `endpoint` values that you need for the plugins to work with your app. The details provided below are general instructions for how to use the plugins with your bundler.

### Rollup/Vite

To use the Rollup/Vite plugin, add the following to your `rollup.config.js` or `vite.config.js`:

```javascript
// other imports
import faroUploader from '@grafana/faro-rollup-plugin';

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => {
  return {
    // other configs
    plugins: [
      // other plugins
      faroUploader({
        appName: "$your-app-name",
        // this URL is different from the Faro Collector URL - find this value in the Frontend Observability plugin under "Settings" -> "Source Maps" -> "Configure source map uploads"
        endpoint: "$your-faro-sourcemap-api-url",
        apiKey: "$your-api-key",
        appId: "$your-app-id",
        stackId: "$your-stack-id",
        gzipContents: true,
      }),
    ],
  };
```

### Configuration Options

The following options are available for the Faro JavaScript bundler plugins:

- `appName: string` *required*: The name of your application. This should match the `appName` value you are using in your Faro Web SDK configuration.
- `endpoint: string` *required*: The URL of your Faro Collector endpoint. This value is in the Frontend Observability plugin under "Settings" -> "Source Maps" -> "Configure source map uploads".
- `apiKey: string` *required*: The API key for your Faro Collector. This value gets generated on grafana.com by creating a new scope (details provided in the plugin and in the "Obtaining API key" section of this document).
- `appId: string` *required*: The ID of your application. This should match the `appId` value you are using in your Faro Web SDK configuration.
- `outputFiles: string[] | RegExp` *optional*: Either an array of source map files to upload, or a regex to match the source map files to upload. By default, all source maps get uploaded.
- `bundleId: string` *optional*: The ID of the bundle/build. You can specify this value to filter by bundle ID in the Frontend Observability plugin. Otherwise the bundler uses an auto-generated ID.
- `keepSourcemaps: boolean` *optional*: Whether to keep the source maps in your generated bundle after uploading. Defaults to `false`.
- `gzipContents: boolean` *optional*: Whether to tarball and Gzip the contents of the source maps before uploading. Defaults to `true`.
- `verbose: boolean` *optional*: Whether to log verbose output during the upload process. Defaults to `false`.

After initial configuration, the Faro JavaScript bundler plugins automatically uploads your source maps to Grafana Cloud when you build your application. You can verify that the source maps upload successfully by in the "Settings" -> "Source Maps" tab in the Frontend Observability plugin. From there you are able to see the source maps that you have uploaded.

After you have completed all the required steps, you have finished - the Faro Collector begins processing your source maps and associating them with your telemetry data. The portions of your stack traces with source maps uploaded to the Faro Collector are automatically de-obfuscated and displayed in the Frontend Observability plugin when viewing your error data.
